# SSL LINK CHECKER
## Get started
- npm install
- npm start
## What it does
- checks if all embedded contents are fetched via secure connection(HTTPS)
(javaScript, stylesheet, anchor, and img)
## Who this is for
- who needs to test a website that recently shifted its connection from http to https.
- who needs some manual checks on the site because there are some restrictions replacing all http links with https dynamically.
